### Tower Blocks Game
In this project my target is to learn how to build a JavaScript Tower Blocks game. The mechanics of the game is just simple and that is to construct  the highest tower by arranging blocks one over the other such that we never disobey Newton's law and by making sure no block can hang in the air. Automatically it will need another block or it will just fall over the ground.
